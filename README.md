# My Configuration Files

I've created this repo to house the files I use to set up my development environment according to my tastes.

To set up the entire thing, just run `setup.sh`, log out, and then log in again.

## Notes:
- For best results, use with the following font(s):
    - Anonymice Nerd Font Mono Regular
    - TerminessTTF Nerd Font Mono Medium
